Welcome to Pytiff
==========

`Pytiff <https://github.com/FZJ-INM1-BDA/pytiff>_` is a Python library for reading and writing large Tiff files.
It supports tiled Tiffs and is able to read only a part of the image.

While this is pytiffs main advantage, it also supports reading of many other image formats and
writing of greyscale images in tile or scanline mode.
